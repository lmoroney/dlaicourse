Course 4 - Advanced Deployment Scenarios with TensorFlow – Examples and Exercises
=================================================================================

This repository contains the examples and exercises that accompany Course 4 - Advanced Deployment Scenarios with TensorFlow of the TensorFlow for Data and Deployment Specialization at Coursera. 

# Jupyter Notebooks

The Jupyter notebooks in the exercises and examples in this course can be run locally or in Google's [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb). We should note that certain cells in the notebooks contain code or interactive forms that will only render when executed in the Colab environment. Therefore, we recommend running the notebooks in the Colab environment. You will still be able run the notebooks locally on your machine, so feel free to work locally if you prefer. If you work locally make sure you have installed TensorFlow 2.x, TensorFlow Hub 0.7.0, and TensorFlow Datasets 2.0.0.
